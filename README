.SYNOPSIS 
  Script to create VMWware DRS Groups and rules based on VMware Tags and a rules file. 

.DESCRIPTION 
  This scripts reads a Rules file (default : .\drs_rules\drs.csv), and the Tags placed on VMs and Hosts.
  
  Based on this, it creates all needed DRS Groups and Rules.
  
  The script is idempotent, when it's re-run, it will update what needed,
  or do nothing if nothing changed in the inputs.
  
  
  FAQ : 
  
  Q: What is this script ?
  A: It creates DRS Rules based on a rules file and tags placed on VMs and hosts.

  Q: in 3 lines, how to use it ?
  A: Assign Tags on VM and host to define your groups.
     Then, write the .\drs_rules\drs.csv file : describe the DRS rules you want to create. (Look at the sample file).
     Then, run the script, it will create all your DRS configuration on the vCenter.

  Q: Why did you create it ?
  A: If you have lots of VMs/Clusters/hosts, maintaining the DRS settings is boring, and everything is manual.
  
  Q: Why not a Tags-Only solution ?
  A: It was my original idea/goal, but was found to be either too limited (only one rule
     for each VM group) or too complicated (need to create per-rule specific tags and assign
     lots of tags).
  
  Q: When should I run this script ?
  A: Just after you assigned/removed tags used for your rules, or changed/added rules in the rules file.
     If you want you can run it periodicaly, no issue.
     You can also start it from the VCBA when a tag is added.
  
.NOTES 
  Script created because vSphere only allows to create groups and rules based on static VM lists, 
  hard to maintain when you have lots of VMs.

.EXAMPLE 

  Simple syntax :

  .\createDrsTagRules.ps1 
  
  The name of the vCenter to connect to and the needed credentials will be prompted on first
  start, and will be saved in the .\script_config\ folder.

  BEFORE FIRST LAUNCH, you have to create the .\drs_rules\drs.csv file. The folder contain sample files.
  

.EXAMPLE 

  Working on only one of the clusters listed in the Rules File : 

  .\createDrsTagRules.ps1 -Cluster ClusterName

.EXAMPLE 

  Working with an alternative Rules file :

  .\createDrsTagRules.ps1 -DrsRulesFile .\Path\To\CustomFile.csv 
  
.EXAMPLE 

  Working with an alternative Credentials file :

  .\createDrsTagRules.ps1 -CredentialsFile .\Path\To\myCreds.file 

.EXAMPLE 

  Exit after the Rules Files was tested (No modification is performed on the vCenter) : 

  .\createDrsTagRules.ps1 -DrsRulesFileValidationOnly 

.EXAMPLE 

  Delete DRS Groups and Rules created by the sctipt.
  
  .\createDrsTagRules.ps1 -DeleteEveryRuleAndGroup
  
  The elements to delete are identified based on their name, which is prefixed by the string "TAG", hardcoded in the script.
  
  A list is displayed, and the user has to confirm before anything is deleted.

.PARAMETER Cluster
  Name of a specific cluster. The rules from the Rules File will be filtered to work only on the rules for this cluster.
  If the parameter is not used, the default behaviour is to create all rules found in the Rules File.

.PARAMETER DrsRulesFile
  Name of the file containing the DRS Rules. By default, .\drs_rules\drs.csv

.PARAMETER CredentialsFile
  Name of the file containing the credentials to acces the vCenter. By default, .\script_config\powercliCreds.xml
  If the file doesn't exist, credentials will be asked and saved in the file.

.PARAMETER DeleteEveryRuleAndGroup
  If this switch is used or set to $true, the Remove code will be executed.
  It will remove all Rules/VM to Host Rules/groups named after the Prefix hardcoded in the script ("TAG")

.PARAMETER DrsRulesFileValidationOnly
  If this switch is used or set to $true, the script will exit after the validation step.
  No modification will be performed on the vSphere server.

.PARAMETER ForceInvalidDrsRulesFile
  If this switch is used or set to $true, the script will continue, event if the content of the DRS Rules file is not correct.
  (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET. THIS SWITCH WILL JUST SKIP THE VALIDATION STEP)

.PARAMETER SkipDrsRulesFileValidation
  If this switch is used or set to $true, the content of the DRS Rules file will be not be checked against incorrect entries.

.PARAMETER KeepLegacyDrsElements
  If this switch is used or set to $true, remove old elements step will be skiped.

==================== Changelog ==============================================

Version : 2022.06.03.0001
    - Initial release.
    - Change Rules and VM to host rules only when enable status or related objects were changed.
    - Avoid redundant updates when a VM or Host Group is used in more than one rule.
    - Display a warning when the DrsRulesFile AND DeleteEveryRuleAndGroup params are given, 
      to point that the delete code don't read things from the Rules file.

==================== Todo list ========================================

Known issues : 
    - Not tested on complex VMware setup (Linked Mode, ...)

Core code
    - Replace -match by -eq when it's appropriate
    - Use Functions ? :)
    - Use local credential store of Windows ?
    - Create Automated tests for CI/CD
    - Gain skills about PS exceptions management and use them
    - Create GUI to create the DRS rules file.
    - Enforce max length of the rule names (Max rulename size is 80 char.
      You can Limit your tags to 29 chars to avoid any issue)
    - Tool to create the configuration from existing, manually made DRS settings ?
    
English text
    - Fix english text
    - Put all messages in vars
    - Make messages more uniform
